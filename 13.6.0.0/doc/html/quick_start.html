<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_systems_agreements_conformance"></a>
Rithmic Systems, Agreements, and Conformance</h1>
<p >When we release an R | API+ dev kit, we create a user id in the Rithmic Test System. The Rithmic Test System is different than Rithmic 01 (live trading) and Rithmic Paper Trading (live market data executing against a simulator). The user id that comes with the dev kit will only work in the Rithmic Test system.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_verify_with_rtrader"></a>
Verify Connectivity, Credentials, And Configuration Using R | Trader</h1>
<p >Using R | Trader or R | Trader Pro is the easiest way to verify connectivity, credentials and configuration. However, it requires that you run on Windows, which may not be the case for your R | API+ application.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_download_rtrader"></a>
Download And Install R | Trader</h2>
<p >You should have received an email with information for how to access your download directory. In the download directory will be files for R | API+. You can download R | Trader or R | Trader Pro from the Rithmic website.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_login_rtrader"></a>
Log In Using R | Trader</h2>
<p >With the dev kit, you will receive login credentials (user id and password) to access a test installation of R | Trade Execution Platform. This test installation is the Rithmic Test system.</p>
<p >The first screen when running R | Trader is the Login screen. Enter a User ID and Password, and select the Rithmic Test system from the drop down box. Successfully logging in confirms network connectivity from the machine (and network) hosting R | Trader as well as the login credentials.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_rtrader_agreements"></a>
Unsigned Agreements</h2>
<p >The first time you log in, you will be required to digitally sign some agreements. In this case, a window entitled "Unsigned Agreements" will appear. To sign an agreement, one clicks on the document name in the Document column. Another window displaying the document will appear. After reading the document, choose the appropriate button to click, perhaps "I Agree". You may need to scroll to the bottom of the document to enable the button. You can also print these agreements from these screens.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_rtrader_market_data"></a>
Market Data Permissions</h2>
<p >Open a Quote Board window. You can do this by selecting Quote Board from the File menu. Search for symbols by right clicking on the Symbol column in the Quote Board window. If you can see market data for this instrument, you have confirmed that your User ID has permissions to view that instrument's market data. If you need permissions for market data that you do not have, contact your broker/FCM to provide market data permsissions as needed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_rtrader_order"></a>
Risk Management Settings</h2>
<p >Try placing an order on that instrument. First open a Recent Orders window to (prepare to) view the order updates as they appear. Next access a Place Order window from the Trade menu. Place an order on the instrument from the previous step. If you can place an order, you confirm that you have risk limits set for your test trading account on that instrument. Your broker/FCM manages your risk settings for your Accounts, so contact them if you need risk settings configured for an Account on an instrument.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_download_rapi"></a>
Download And Install</h1>
<p >The R | API+.NET dev kit zip file should be in your download directory. There is no formal installation program. Just unzip the files to the location of your choice. The root directory of the zip file is the version number of the API. There is a subdirectory called "samples" which contains code for sample applications.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_configure_sample"></a>
Configure Sample Code</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="qs_configure_sample_installation"></a>
Configure For A Rithmic Installation</h2>
<p >You will not need to change any code if you are going to connect to the Rithmic Test system. All the sample source code is "pre-configured" for this Rithmic system.</p>
<p >If you do need to connect to a different Rithmic system, you will need to go through conformance as well has have valid credentials for the system you wish to use. To begin the conformance process, email the RAPI support team at <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'rap'+'i@'+'rit'+'hm'+'ic.'+'co'+'m'; return false;">rapi@<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>rith<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>mic.c<span class="obfuscator">.nosp@m.</span>om</a>.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_build_sample"></a>
Build Sample Code</h1>
<p >R | API+ dev kit ships with a market data sample, an order placement sample and an OHLC bar sample. There is a separate solution for building on .NET Framework 3.5 and another for building on .NET Framework 4.7.2 (at least at the time of this writing). All the samples are in the directory samples, and the solutions and associated projects are in separate sub-directories beginning with SamplesPlus.NET with a suffix indicating the framework version. The source code for the samples is also contained in a sub-directory with the suffix of src. Each of these samples are console applications, and they do take command line arguments. After building them, you may want to either modify the source to hard code the command line arguments, or set the arguments in Visual Studio to allow for debugging.</p>
<p >The <a class="el" href="programmers_guide.html">Programmers' Guide</a> has more detailed information about building applications using the API. See <a class="el" href="programmers_guide.html#pg_building_dotnet">Building A .NET Rithmic API Application</a>.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_running_sample"></a>
Running Sample Applications</h1>
<p >Once you have built the sample applications, you can run them from a command prompt or perhaps from within Visual Studio.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_verify_sample_md"></a>
Verify Market Data Functionality With SampleMD</h1>
<p >SampleMD is a console application. It does not use a GUI; it runs from a command prompt. If you built it without changing the source code, you should open a command prompt and change your working directory to be the same as the EXE binary. If you run it without any parameters, it will display its usage. The parameters it takes are : </p><ul>
<li>
user : This is your User ID, and is passed into REngine::login() </li>
<li>
password : This is your Password, and is passed into REngine::login() </li>
<li>
exchange : This is the instrument exchange, going to REngine::subscribe(). Try "CME". </li>
<li>
symbol : This is the instrument symbol, also going to REngine::subscribe(). Try "ESM4". You may need to modify the month code (M) and year (4) if the June 2024 contract has already expired. You might try month codes of H, M, U or Z. You can also try year codes from 0 to 9. </li>
</ul>
<p >Once it is running, compare data showing in SampleMD and R | Trader (connecting to the Rithmic Test system). They should match.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_verify_sample_order"></a>
Verify Order Functionality With SampleOrder</h1>
<p >SampleOrder is also a console application. It will place a market order on the instrument and side of your choice. If you built it without changing the source code, you should open a command prompt and change your working directory to be the same as the EXE binary. If you run it without any parameters, it will display its usage. The parameters it takes are : </p><ul>
<li>
user : This is your User ID, and is passed into REngine::login() </li>
<li>
password : This is your Password, and is passed into REngine::login() </li>
<li>
exchange : This is the instrument exchange, going to REngine::sendOrder(). Try "CME". </li>
<li>
symbol : This is the instrument symbol, also going to REngine::sendOrder(). Try "ESZ6". You may need to modify the month code (Z) and year (6) if the December 2026 contract has already expired. You might try month codes of H, M, U or Z. You can also try year codes from 0 to 9. </li>
<li>
side : This is the side of the order, also going to REngine::sendOrder(). Try "B" or "S". </li>
</ul>
<p >When running SampleOrder, watch for the order updates to appear in R | Trader's Recent Orders window. Verify that the data between the two applications match. They should.</p>
<hr  />
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qs_next_steps"></a>
Next Steps</h1>
<p >You might want to either begin using the R | API immediately and reference the documentation as necessary, or read more documentation at this point. The <a class="el" href="faq.html">F.A.Q.</a> and <a class="el" href="programmers_guide.html">Programmers' Guide</a> contains more general information about how to use the R | API, while the class/method documentation contains more targeted information.</p>
