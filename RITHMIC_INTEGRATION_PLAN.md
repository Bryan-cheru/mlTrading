### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

#### **Rithmic API Integration**
```python
# New data connector structure:
class RithmicConnector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api = RithmicAPI()
        self.market_data = {}
        self.order_book = {}
        
    def subscribe_es_data(self):
        # Subscribe to ES futures real-time data
        symbols = ["ESZ4", "ESH5"]  # Current and next contracts
        for symbol in symbols:
            self.api.subscribe_market_data(symbol)
            self.api.subscribe_market_depth(symbol)
            
    def get_market_features(self):
        # Extract features for ML model
        features = {
            'bid_ask_spread': self.calculate_spread(),
            'order_imbalance': self.calculate_imbalance(),
            'market_pressure': self.calculate_pressure(),
            'volume_profile': self.get_volume_profile()
        }
        return features
```

#### **Enhanced Feature Engineering**
```python
# New features with Rithmic data:
class RithmicFeatureEngine:
    def extract_microstructure_features(self, tick_data):
        return {
            'order_flow_imbalance': self.calc_flow_imbalance(tick_data),
            'bid_ask_pressure': self.calc_ba_pressure(tick_data),
            'volume_weighted_pressure': self.calc_vw_pressure(tick_data),
            'market_maker_activity': self.detect_mm_activity(tick_data),
            'liquidity_indicators': self.calc_liquidity(tick_data)
        }
```
