### **🛡️ Risk Management Integration**

The system includes **5-layer risk management** that affects signal accuracy:

1. **Position Size Risk**: Limits exposure per trade
2. **Portfolio Risk**: Maximum 20% allocation per instrument  
3. **Volatility Risk**: Reduces position size in high volatility
4. **Correlation Risk**: Limits correlated positions
5. **Drawdown Protection**: Stops trading at 3% daily loss

**Impact on Accuracy**: Risk management can **increase overall profitability by 15-25%** even if it reduces the number of signals generated.
